# General Assembly Responsive Website Project
This project was developed in order to demonstrate knowledge of developing responsive web design. All content with the project relies purely on HTML and CSS.


# Example

Here is an example of some of the CSS that was used to create the app!

```CSS
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 20px 100px;
  font-family: arial;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
h1 {
  font-family: arial;
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 20px;
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}

h4 {
  font-size: 18px;
}
i {
  margin: 0;
}
```

**WOW LOOK AT THAT CSS** That's some amazing `code!`
